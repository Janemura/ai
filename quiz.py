1. TensorFlow is an open-source ML framework from Google. Key features: distributed computing, automatic differentiation, extensive tooling, flexible deployment options, and TensorBoard for visualization.

2. PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs built on-the-fly during execution, while TensorFlow traditionally used static graphs defined beforehand (though TF 2.0+ also supports eager execution).

3. Keras is a high-level neural networks API. Can run on TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), and Theano frameworks.

4. Scikit-learn key features: supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms, model selection tools, preprocessing utilities, dimensionality reduction, consistent API, and NumPy/SciPy/Pandas compatibility.

5. Jupyter Notebooks are interactive computing environments that combine code, text, and visualizations with cell-by-cell execution, multi-language support, easy sharing, and an extensible architecture.

6. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

7. Optimizers in PyTorch update model parameters to minimize the loss function.

8. Conv2D layers apply convolution operations to extract spatial features from images.
