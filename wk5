% 1. TensorFlow and Its Key Features  
   TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning platform created by Google. It is well-regarded for its flexibility—offering both high-level and low-level APIs—its scalability across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, and its robust ecosystem that includes tools such as TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow.js, and TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

% 2. TensorFlow vs. PyTorch: Computation Graphs
   The main distinction is that TensorFlow employs a static computation graph, meaning the graph is built before execution, while PyTorch utilizes a dynamic computation graph that is constructed on the fly during runtime. This dynamic approach makes PyTorch more flexible and intuitive, especially for research purposes.

% 3. Keras and Its Supported Frameworks
   Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation with deep learning models. It can run on top of: TensorFlow, Theano, and CNTK frameworks.

% 4. Key Features of Scikit-learn 
   Scikit-learn is a Python library for machine learning that offers a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. It is user-friendly due to its consistent API and thorough documentation, and it integrates seamlessly with other libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

% 5. Purpose and Key Features of Jupyter Notebooks
   Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that enables users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key features: an interactive coding environment, support for multiple languages (like Python, R, and Julia), and the ability to display rich outputs such as visualizations and tables.

% 6. Purpose of the Dropout Layer in the TensorFlow Example 
   In the TensorFlow example, the Dropout layer is used to help prevent overfitting during training. It randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during each update, which encourages the model to learn more general features that perform better on unseen data.

% 7. Role of the Optimizer in the PyTorch Example 
   The optimizer in PyTorch is responsible for updating the model’s parameters (such as weights and biases) based on the computed gradients during training. The Adam optimizer is used,  for its efficient performance in training deep learning models.

% 8. Purpose of the Conv2D Layer in Keras 
   The Conv2D layer in  Keras serves as a convolutional layer that extracts features from the input image. It performs convolution operations to detect patterns like edges, textures, and other spatial hierarchies within the data.

% 9. Scikit-learn Model and Dataset  
 Random Forest classifier, an ensemble model well-suited for classification tasks, which is applied to the Iris dataset—a classic dataset commonly used to demonstrate classification techniques.

% 10. Output of the Jupyter Notebook and Visualization Library 
    The output of the Jupyter Notebook  is a plot of a sine wave. This visualization is created using the matplotlib library, a widely used Python tool for generating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
